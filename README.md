# SlidingPanelLayout
This demo application provides a simple way to add a draggable sliding panel, like the one in Android lollipop quick contact details panel and share dialog / panel in Runtastic Sleep Better, to your Android application.

This layout can very easily be added on top of existing layouts / screens. It pops up from the bottom taking 60% of the screen space and then can be dragged from there to see rest of the content it has. The dragging has a very beautiful bounce back effect when threshold velocity for dragging is not met OR threshold distance for dragging is not met, in this order respectively.
